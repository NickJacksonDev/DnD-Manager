from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

# Notes (Django models)
# Each model acts more or less like a database table
# Each model's field acts like a column in said table
# Foreign Keys act as a thing that links a class
# to a parent class that uses it. 
#  eg: abilityScore's "characterID" is a foreign key


# Description of this model file
# Much of this will be based off of the database schemas

# As this is in the character builder folder, this will focus on
# the character information
